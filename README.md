### What I learned

Taking on this challenge taught me a whole lot in the world of Frontend Development and also helped me improve on my frontend coding skills.
In my course of completing the challenge, I learnt:
 - how to validate a form using vanilla JavaScript
 - how to use JavaScript to create a sliding effect 

Below is a code snippet of how I was able to validate the form before it submits.

```html
<form action="" onsubmit="return validateForm()" id="formbox" autocomplete="off">
          <input type="text" id="inbox" placeholder="Updates in your inboxâ€¦">
          <span id="alert"></span>
          <button type="submit" id="submit">Go</button>
</form>
```

```JavaScript
function validateForm() {
    let input = document.getElementById("inbox").value;
    let alert = document.getElementById("alert");
    let form = document.getElementById("formbox");

    let pattern = /[a-z]@/;

    if(input.match(pattern)){
        form.classList.add("valid");
        form.classList.remove("invalid");
        return true
    }

    else{
        form.classList.remove("valid");
        form.classList.add("invalid");
        alert.innerHTML = "Please insert a valid email";
        return false
    }
}
```
